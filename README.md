BuddyPress First Letter Avatar
==============

### Fork from Dev49's plugin https://github.com/Dev49net/buddypress-first-letter-avatar due to it not being updated for over 3 years. 

A WordPress-BuddyPress plugin to set custom avatars for users with no Gravatar and no profile avatar. The avatar will be the first (or any other) letter of user's name.

## Description

This plugin is based on Dev49's plugin https://github.com/Dev49net/buddypress-first-letter-avatar and was forked to maintain on our side as it hasn't been updated in over 3 years. 

What it does is, by default, checks if user has configured her/his avatar or has Gravatar assigned to the email address. If neither of them is present - custom avatar is used. Custom avatar consists of the first letter of user's name and a colorful background. 

BuddyPress First Letter Avatar helps you bring more colors into your BuddyPress site. Plus, your users will be more willing to actively participate in your site since they can actually relate to these avatars much better than to Mystery Person.

BuddyPress First Letter Avatar includes a set of beautiful, colorful letter avatars in many sizes. Optimal size will be chosen by the plugin in order to display high quality avatar and not download, for example, big 512px avatars when only 48px is needed... PSD template for avatar is also included. 

Plugin is highly configurable - you can disable Gravatar, disable displaying user's avatars, choose different letter, use custom sets of avatars, use rounded avatars etc.

All images were compressed using the fantastic [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so avatars are incredibly light and ultra-high quality.

## Requirements

BuddyPress First Letter Avatar requires at least PHP 5.4. It **does not work properly** on PHP 5.3.x and earlier.
